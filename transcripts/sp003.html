                 is only really that are on their own and that's because they are separate legal entities so all 31 colleges a separate legal entities they have their own data protection officer or will need one or some part of one and they need to sort of put together there own tool kit but James is quite happy for them to look through the talk at the we have and anything that you as have created as well to help them should they wish to use it so you can help me sort them but we can't actually do it for them exactly yes that's totally true there are things that I've created here although the teams of people who have created that help us towards compliance and we're happy for the ecologist to borrow them all use them but we won't be holding their results brilliant so what do people have you need to have in place for the 24th of May and what can a dented of trickling afterwards well there is rather and loss actually and the toolkit goes through all that time I'm mostly involved with

                 cit side of it and the requirements under the i t section which section 7 of the tool kit so that's basically looking at privacy notices filling in the information asset register photographs or staff profiles on publicly available websites we need to ensure that those students or staff have been given an opportunity to opt out so that's the compliance action on that we also have to inform staff of information security response including personal data breach response and we have to try to embed data protection by design into all our new designs in ITU so what we do the new iOS to help the community with the compliance ok we've done quite a few things actually we've got a project about the information asset register itself which is referred to in the toolkit that James has sent out we also created a system security checklist

                 it is a way of checking the technical and organisational measures of a system so it includes questions such as is there a pen test policy or do you have a starters and leavers procedure or when did you last see your updates and are all your service up to date with malware protection so they're questions like that specifically on the system I've also written another checklist which is called the gdpr checklist and that is for checking if your system is ready for gdpr in terms of whether it can cope with things like withdrawal of consent or whether you can cover the data subject rights not whether you ought to because that must be done by the legal services office or James Knapton together but whether your system is capable of restricting processing or deleting a user or updating information if it's

                 not correct I've also done a lot of work on presentations and getting things across to people but also I've done quite a lot of work on privacy notices know this means that I've spoken to David Carter who runs the parts of the Falcon service and so he's updating the privacy notice on the 450 Falcon sites ready for you to just insert your specific bit for your particular web service and similarly I've spoken to the Drupal team and we're pointing everything to a main privacy notice which I've written for the main www.cam.ac.uk website so if you go there and have a look at the about this site privacy notice you'll see that I've written that in a very short form and a very sort of English way so there's no technical stuff in there and then hooked up or linked up to the general data

                 privacy notice which James Knapton has already written James has already written student privacy notices staff applicants privacy notices job application notices etc cetera and the idea is to centralise all the privacy notices and therefore you at your site just need to link into the main ones and then put anything else you think is relevant specifically for your site into your initial notice the idea therefore is that we don't have to rewrite thousands and thousands of privacy notices across the university we just have to link each one of those notices to the main set of notices that we've already written for you ok thank you buddy well that's it for another month as I said at the top we really want your email we really want your feedback please send it to PM 107 that's papa bike one
